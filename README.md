1-App description
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square table top, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. There are no
other obstructions on the table surface. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but can be prevented
from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table is coded to be prevented,
however further valid movement commands are still allowed.
